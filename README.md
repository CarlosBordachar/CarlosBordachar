### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
### I'm glad to see you here!

Let me tell you something about me and this.

There isn't too much here. It's my personal account and I mainly use it for learning purposes and personal projects. :seedling:

I'm a software developer (with a software engineering :mortar_board: degree and all those things that make moms happy :innocent:). I'm mainly a C# backend developer using SQL-Server for persistence.

C# was my first big love; but right now I'm looking to learn something new, just like the popular and great (? Python. :star_struck:

I don't like Mark's networks, so you can find me anywhere else. :mailbox_closed:

Anything else, just ask me.

Goodbye, and have a great day! :wave:
